# Pokemon battle prediction
This is a repo containing a simple data analisys project to evaluate which pokemon would win in a 1v1 fight.

The data has been acquired from kaggle: [dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon).
## Project structure
The project contains two main files
- `main.ipynb` contains all of the code necessary to view the data, manipulate it and train models using it.
- `website.ipynb` contains only the portion of the code necessary to run a website used to interact with the trained models.

## How to run
1. Create a python virtual environment using `python -m venv ./venv`.
2. Activate the virtual environment `./venv/Scripts/activate`
3. Install the required libraries on the virtual environment `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`.
4. Use the virtual environment through `anaconda` or any `jupyter notebook` runtime.
